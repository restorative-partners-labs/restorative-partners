    question: "What is Restorative Justice",
    ans: `An area of special concern has been the neglect of victims and their needs; legal justice is largely about what to do with offenders.

    question: "Restorative Conference (RC)",
    ans: `
    RC’s are structured meetings between offenders, victims and both parties’ family and friends, in which they deal with the consequences of wrongdoing and decide how best to repair the harm. Neither a counseling nor a mediation process, conferencing is a victim-sensitive, straightforward problem-solving method that demonstrates how people can resolve their own problems when provided with a constructive forum to do so.
